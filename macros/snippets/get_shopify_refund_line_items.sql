{#-
    Shopify's GraphQL Admin API schema renamed `order_line_refund` to
    `refund_line_item` and moved the money fields into `*_set_shop_amount`.
    Connectors created before the switch still land the legacy shape.

    This macro emits a SELECT that normalises BOTH shapes to the legacy column
    names, so downstream models (and get_shopify_clean_field) stay unchanged.
    Handles legacy-only, graphql-only, and mixed multi-store projects.

    NOTE: get_relations_by_pattern runs a query, so during dbt's parse phase
    (execute == False) both lists come back empty and this macro renders to an
    empty string. That is expected -- the real relations are resolved on the
    run phase. Every check below must therefore be guarded by `execute`.
